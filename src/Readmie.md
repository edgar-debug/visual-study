ipsum Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
industry. ipsum Ipsum has been the industry's standard 
dummytext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen 
book. It hassurvived not only five centuries, but also the 
leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 
1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
containing ipsum Ipsum passages, and more 
recently with desktop publishing 
software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of ipsum Ipsum.
